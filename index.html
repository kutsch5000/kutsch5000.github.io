      <h2>about me</h2>
      <p>
        Graphic designer with a degree in Visual Communication Design from Eastern Washington University. However, I did attend University of Oregon and Sacramento State University as well. I grew up in a graphic design household and have always had a passion and eye for it. Some of my other passions include running, I was a cross country and track athlete all the way through college, and despite years of injuries I finished with a personal record in the mile of 4:12. I am also a climber, I have climbed Mt. Rainier 4 times, 1 of those times in under 20 hours rather than the typical 2 days. I also love photography, I believe in the old-school way of photography and still prefer to shoot with my large format 4x5 film camera when I can, because the quality of film is still unmatched in the digital world.

        As for the design aspect of my life, I have been spoiled growing up in a house with a graphic designer for a Dad. My strengths include branding packages, event campaigns, and shirt designs. However, I am overall a very well-rounded designer. I have had the pleasure of getting to design a few Spokane Hoopfest shirts each year since 2011 as well as some other side projects here and there.
